Some guides on Java classes and libraries that I wrote in Russian for personal use, for the purposes of teaching Java, originally aimed at beginners with knowledge of Java syntax, but not libraries. I publish them to github, because why not? :) Non-Russian-speakers are unlikely to find them useful, though.

Requirements:
- pandoc (.md -> .html)
- wkhtmltopdf (.html -> .pdf)

To enable internal links in generated PDF files, download a statically linked version of wkhtmltopdf from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/ instead of using the version provided in the Linux distribution.
